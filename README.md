# Instagram Clone
### *Let's try to recreate Instagram.*

-

This is an instagram clone (with some graphic modification).
The following functionalities are present: register with a profile image, login, logout, user profile page and new images upload.

-

Difficulties:

- Setting up AWS public bucket (policy) to store the uploaded images.
- Recreating an instagram-clone user experience.

Not working:

- The .then() part of user deleteRoute is not working (res.unauthorized is not a function).
